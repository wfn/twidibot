twidibot
================

Description:
-------------------

Twitter bot PoC, with the intention of becoming a new BridgeDB Distributor.

Includes ideas and/or code for abstracting things in ways that would isolate /
separate certain functionalities in BridgeDB.

Meaningful README when there's more meaningful code.

[Link to initial proposal document which includes design goes here.]

Installation:
-------------------

See [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md)

You'll need to create a "twidibot/config.py", possibly from [sample_config.py]
(./twidibot/sample_config.py).

Running:
-------------------

"Ha."

Well:

`python quick_run.py` should be able to run the thing as currently intended.
The bot PoC functionality should then work.
